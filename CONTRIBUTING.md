Pull requests for bug fixes, code optimizations and documentation improvements
are very welcome.

Please discuss potential new features and their implementation details first.

While we appreciate all contributions, please understand that we may not be
able to merge every pull request, even those of high quality, due to project
direction, maintenance considerations, or other factors.

Please note that feature branches should be rebased.

For commit messages, we loosely follow [A Note About Git Commit Messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), with the exception of longer headers, where
sensible.
